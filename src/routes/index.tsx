    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>A pretty barren site at the moment. Hope to add more content over time, at least to the point of
      needing a hosting service to hold a non-static site. <br/>
      I'm a software developer who recently graduated from University of Washington. I've been looking for a job for while by now, so, at the moment,
      I've been spending a lot of my time learning new software, tools, and languages to expand my appeal. <em>If you have a programming position in mind, please don't
        hesitate to contact me at anguyen1048@gmail.com!</em><br/>
      Whenever I'm not doing extra studying or applying, I mainly like to play video games, and I have a special interest in music games. Once I get a job, I'd like to
      dedicate more of my free time learning using FL Studio, too. <br/> <br/>

      If you stumbled upon this website, I hope you keep it bookmarked as I update it!

      <em>I probably should put a picture of myself here, but I don't exactly feel like it; I'll probably put a cute drawing here if I can think of
        something to put here
